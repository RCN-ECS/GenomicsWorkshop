# Making travel plans

The RCN will reimburse participants for the flights, parking, mileage, and other travel-related expenses. Because we will be arranging shuttles to and from LAX and boats to and from Catalina, we may not have the budget to reimburse participants who get out to Catalina by other means.

## August 15

### Flying in to LAX - arrive by 11:30 am

At 12:30pm, an RCN-sponsored shuttle bus will take participants from LAX to the dock where the boat will leave from. Please plan for your flight to arrive early enough to LAX so that you have time to catch the shuttle.

Please fill out this form by March 1 to request a seat on the bus. ADD LINK.

### Chartered boats from San Pedro to Catalina depart at 2pm from dock

We have chartered two boats to take participants from [Southern California Marine Institute](https://www.google.com/maps/place/820+S+Seaside+Ave,+San+Pedro,+CA+90731/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x80dd364c789a0687:0x41eeeb76e557b5ea?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiMwse6-NHnAhXDmeAKHfFmD4wQ8gEwAHoECAsQAQ) to [USC Wrigley Marine Science Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/USC+Wrigley+Marine+Science+Center/@33.4447943,-118.5184914,13z/data=!4m19!1m13!4m12!1m6!1m2!1s0x80dd68770a7f4965:0xd7924fbb2751aa29!2sUSC+Wrigley+Marine+Science+Center,+Big+Fisherman+Cove,+Avalon,+CA!2m2!1d-118.4834719!2d33.4447276!1m3!2m2!1d-118.4784927!2d33.4465784!3e0!3m4!1s0x80dd68770a7f4965:0xd7924fbb2751aa29!8m2!3d33.4447276!4d-118.4834719) on Catalina Island.
