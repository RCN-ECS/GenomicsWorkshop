# Genomics Workshop 2020 August XX - XX

## Location
Catalina Island Wrigley Institute

## Application
[Link will be added]

## Schedule

### Morning 1: Presentations: Hypothesis Testing and Integrative Analyses in Genomics

We invite presentations for testing hypotheses in genomics from a variety of marine and non-marine systems
that go beyond simple "identify the genes." 

### Afternoon 1: Discussion of filtering, standards, and best practices

High heterozygosity and many types of complex mutations (structural variants, index, and triallelic sites)
appear to be common in marine organisms. In this discussion we will invite stories about best practicies for filtering
mapped reads for population genomics anayses, *de novo* reference genome assembly 
in non-model organisms, 
Note that we don't want to focus too much on methods that may become outdated in a few years, but we recognize
that we need to identify and define some best practices and guidelines for genomics data analysis.


Evening 1: Poster session
Morning 2: Presentations: Seascape genomes and seascape data
Afternoon 2: Discussion of Using genomic data to define management units in marine systems  and when understanding adaptation requires knowing the genes
Evening 2: poster session
Morning 3: transgenics
Afternoon 3: open for breakout groups, collaborations, etc.
